/**
 * Interface that specifies an API to programmatically manage transaction
 * savepoints in a generic fashion. Extended by TransactionStatus to
 * expose savepoint management functionality for a specific transaction.
 *
 * 该接口定义一种以编程、通用的方式来管理保存点；该接口被{@link TransactionStatus}继承；然后暴露
 * 出相应的方法来操作指定事务中的保存点
 *
 * <p>Note that savepoints can only work within an active transaction.
 * Just use this programmatic savepoint handling for advanced needs;
 * else, a subtransaction with PROPAGATION_NESTED is preferable.
 *
 * <p>This interface is inspired by JDBC 3.0's Savepoint mechanism
 * but is independent from any specific persistence technology.
 *
 * 该接口用于管理保存点并提供创建保存点、释放保存点和回滚保存点等方法（借助于底层数据库的支持；mysql可以支持保存点）
 *
